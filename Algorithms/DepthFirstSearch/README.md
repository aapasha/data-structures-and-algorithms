# Depth First Search (DFS)

#### Big-O

###### Time complexity:
`O(|V|)` where |V| is the number of vertices 

###### Space complexity: 
`O(mb)` where m is the number of nodes in the longest path, and b is the number of neighbors for each m

#### Intro
"Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Extra memory, usually a stack, is needed to keep track of the nodes discovered so far along a specified branch which helps in backtracking of the graph."
