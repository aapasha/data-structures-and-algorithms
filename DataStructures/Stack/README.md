# Stack

In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two main operations:

Push, which adds an element to the collection, and
Pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.

The order in which an element added to or removed from a stack is described as last in, first out, referred to by the acronym LIFO. As with a stack of physical objects, this structure makes it easy to take an item off the top of the stack, but accessing a datum deeper in the stack may require taking off multiple other items first.
